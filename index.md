This workshop is targeted at researchers, musicians, and everyone interested in new sensing technologies, human physiological data, and interactive applications. Participants will be introduced to FLOW™ by one of the technology’s developers and led through the basics of breathing data collection. Next, they will try FLOW™ through practical exercises. 
At the end of this lesson, participants will be able to generate their own breathing visualizations and work in mini-projects involving breathing, music, and computing.

This lesson has been developed by Victor Gonzalez Sanchez and Sagar Sen.
